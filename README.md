## NOVOCOIN (NOZ)

Novocoin private untraceable cryptocurrency.
Novocoin is an open-sourced decentralized cryptocurrency with untraceable payment.
Novocoin is using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured.
Novocoin uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the ledger of transactions that everyone has). 
This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default


## About this Project

This is the core implementation of Novocoin. It is open source and completely free to use
without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below. There are
no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of Novocoin that uses the
protocol and network in a compatible manner.

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the
"staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that master repo,
they are tested by individual developers, as well as contributors who focus on thorough
testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully
considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the 
repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally
a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

Anyone is able to contribute to Novocoin. If you have a fix or code change, feel free to
submit is as a pull request. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not
affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the
collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it
is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull
request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.

## Deployment Notes

1. When running the daemon, take care to ensure that the console output is not blocked, as this may in turn cause processing threads to be blocked, potentially resulting in unreliable operation of the daemon. This can occur because the implementation contains many logging statements which send output to the console within the context of the processing thread, and if the output buffer fills up this will block the thread. The best practice is to start the daemon within the context of a background process manager such as screen or tmux, or within a terminal window on a physical or virtual console. In doing so be sure that the session is not left in 'scrollback' or 'edit' mode as this may eventualy cause the output to block.
2. The daemon currently has high resource usage especially memory. To ensure reliable performance (especially on mining/pool nodes where poor performance can result in increase 'orphan blocks'), ensure that the daemon is being run on hardware with sufficient memory to avoid excessive swapping and long pauses. While it is possible to operate with limited memory and swap in some cases (though not recommended for mining), this requires care and a platform with sufficient I/O performance (e.g. unthrottled SSD). In the latter case also see the next item.
3. One cause of high resource usage and long processing delays is the periodic saving of the blockchain every 12 hours. Doing so requires access to the entire memory space and potentially large amounts of swapping. It can be disabled using the `--disable-save` option. The blockchain will still be saved on exit or upon request using the save command.
4. If using the rpc wallet (simplewallet --rpc-bind-port), access to the wallet RPC port will allow sending funds from the wallet. By default the rpc port is bound to the loopback interface so access is only possible from the same system. You are responsible for appropriately controlling/limiting access to the port (eg. using virtualization, firewall settings, etc.) to prevent loss of funds. If not using the --rpc-bind-port the wallet does not accept remote commands and this issue does not apply.

## Building Novocoin

### On *nix

Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55.

You may download them from:

* http://gcc.gnu.org/
* http://www.cmake.org/
* http://www.boost.org/
* Alternatively, it may be possible to install them using a package manager.

To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run `make`. The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/src`.

**Advanced options:**

* Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`.
* Debug build: run `make build-debug`.
* Test suite: run `make test-release` to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug` will do the same to the debug version.
* Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not work everywhere. To build, run `export CC=clang CXX=clang++` before running `make`.

### On Windows
Dependencies: MSVC 2013 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55. You may download them from:

* http://www.microsoft.com/
* http://www.cmake.org/
* http://www.boost.org/

To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run theas commands: 
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64" ..
```

And then do Build.
Good luck!
